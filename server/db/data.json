    "description": "WHAT IS YAAK?\n\nYaak is developing an open-source embodied AI platform that prioritizes safety. Partnering with domain experts around the world, we collect their demonstrations and feedback to train large multimodal models (LMMs) which are then fine-tuned for downstream tasks like detecting and correcting incorrect operation and generating novel scenarios. We actually don't do anything with yaks.\n\nWHY ARE YOU WORKING ON HUMAN DRIVING?\n\nAt Yaak we asked ourselves: what if we engage domain experts in building foundation models for embodied AI (e.g human driving)?. To that end, we repurposed the existing infrastructure for human centric training processes to collect invaluable data at scale. By design the training processes encounter wide categories of scenarios required for a human to learn safe operation of the platform, allowing us to extract and build scenario cards (ranked by risk) for each city where our customer fleet operates, which are then used to train foundation embodied AI models. The scenario cards are also open-sourced for the wider embodied AI community to benchmark against, without having to operate a development fleet in a new city, bringing transparency and accountability to the development of embodied AI.\n\nTHE ROLE\n\nAs a Full-Stack Developer you will:\n\n\n\n * Participate in designing, writing and supporting robust, responsive and well crafted software\n * Take a leading role in documenting and designing client/server side architecture\n * Work with our designers to implement responsive frontend and interactions\n * Develop backend services as well as design, extend and maintain APIs\n * Write clean and minimal code with a focus on readability and longevity\n * Take ownership for the quality assessment of your projects\n * Predict technical roadblocks and plan for the posterity of our software stack\n * Bring the latest and greatest of OSS tools and knowledge to our org\n   \n   \n   \n\nQualifications\n\nYou won't see hard requirements here for certain degrees or exact years of experience because we know everyone has their own unique journey.

From sourdough to spaceships you are fascinated by complex problems.\n * A Pragmatist. Complex problems don't always require complicated solutions.\n * A Learner. No matter the topic, you like to casually learn new things.\n * A Team Player. You work well with others, and are willing to think out loud.\n * A Leader. You lead by listening to colleagues, as well as setting a good example.\n * A Self-Starter. You take initiative instead of waiting around for task assignment.\n * A Nerd. You love experimenting with the latest features, languages and tools.\n   \n   \n   \n\nYOU HAVE:\n\n\n\n * A proven track record of working with both front-end and back-end development, having hands-on experience with either ReactJS or Go\n * Demonstrated ability with TypeScript\n * ES6+, OOP, and functional programming knowledge\n * Demonstrated ability with at least one strongly typed programming language\n * Experience developing for mobile apps and web\n * Experience in collaborating with designers, engineers and product managers, familiarity with sprint workflows\n * Shown comfort working and communicating in English\n * Experience developing or integrating a REST API\n   \n   \n   \n\nBIG PLUS FOR:\n\n\n\n * Proficiency in both React AND Go\n * Experience in developing complex, multi-platform applications (web and mobile)\n * Being part of developing a project from its conception to shipment\n * Building body of work with examples of well executed, responsive frontend work\n * Experience in communicating technical problems and solutions to a diverse audience\n * Public projects that speak volumes of your craft and your passion for it\n   \n   \n   \n\nPERKS\n\n\n\n * Competitive compensation package with employee share program\n * Flexible work-from-home policy\n * Work in an international team full of talented, chill and cooky people\n   \n   \n   \n\nDIVERSITY IN TECH\n\nYaak is committed to fostering diversity and inclusion.

    "description": "Our mission\n\nImagine yourself designing and implementing the next breakthrough AI/Machine-Learning services, enabling AI for everyone at the start of the company's explosive growth.\n\nAt super.AI, we are building services to enable AI/Machine Learning technologies for the masses. We are at the exciting stage where the growth of our company forces us to do aggressive hirings to realize our visions quicker.\n\nWe automate the processing of images, audio, video, and text using AI so people can be more human. Our Unified AI Platform for unstructured data processing has been adopted by leading insurance, financial services, retail, technology, agriculture, and testing, inspection, and certification (TIC) services companies. We strive to democratize access to artificial intelligence and use AI to enrich the human experience.\n\nYour profile\n\nWhat you'll do:\n\n\n\n * Design/implement a system orchestrating machine learning workflows\n * Build SDKs to enable engineers using our platform easily\n * Build tools to enable our AI engineers be efficient in developing new AI solutions\n   \n   \n   \n\nWhat we are looking for:\n\nSmart, humble, hardworking, and collaborative\n * By smart we don't necessarily mean high IQ (although a huge plus), but an affinity toward learning. We want to automate as much as possible so we can focus on the few things that require human intelligence and creativity.\n * By humble we don't mean submissive or unambitious, we mean it in the same way Roger Federer is humble.\n * By hardworking, we don't mean long hours (be with your family). What we mean is while you're here you're doing the best work of your life. It means being disciplined, professional, focused, gritty, resilient, and resourceful.\n * By collaborative, we don't mean submissive or deferential, it means taking leadership from everywhere. \"I'm taking responsibility to fix this system\", if there's a lack of trust \"I'm going to address it\", if goals are unclear \"I'm going to deal with it\", it's about being a meritocracy\n * All four of the above are required. We all know people missing one of these and it's not nice to work with them (e.g. someone who is smart and hardworking but not humble and collaborative).\n   \n\nParadoxical\n * The people we like the most are smart but humble\n * Wants to win no matter what, but will not cross lines of integrity to get there\n * Strong beliefs weakly held, etc.\n * 3+ years of software engineering experience\n * Solid foundational knowledge of Java, Python, React/Angular\n * Familiarity with distributed system and cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP) is a plus\n   \n   \n   \n\nIf this resonates with you, it would be amazing to get to know each other- reach out and send an application!\n\n\n\n * We believe AI is going to be the most impactful technology ever invented. It may be the last technology we ever needed to invent as humans. We don’t want it to be in the hands of the few, but the hands of the many. Our technology promises to transform the way AI is created and consumed to make this vision possible.\n * We are searching for the best-of-the-best to build a massive company, but at the same time a company where people are happy with their lives, feel healthy, passionate and satisfied.\n * We're 30 people and have just launched, so you will have the opportunity to shape things from the beginning and see the company grow\n * Although super.AI is young, this is not our first rodeo: our CEO previously founded a few hundred person company, and between us we've held senior positions at Google, Amazon, Adobe, Microsoft, McKinsey\n   ",

Because sustainability is important to us, we make sure to offer primarily vegetarian and vegan food, not only in the kitchen, but also for events and team meals. And the fun continues outside the office: in addition to enjoying a 30% discount on all JUNIQE art, our employees also benefit from a range of partnerships including reduced membership at the Urban Sports Club.\n\nSounds good? Then send us your CV including cover letter, possible start date and your salary expectations. We are an equal opportunities employer and we value diversity in our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status or disability. Even if you don't tick every box in the job description but can see yourself contributing to the future of JUNIQE, you should apply. Help us build an inclusive community that will change the art market.\n\nAbout Us\n\nMake your house a home with JUNIQE's curated selection of premium posters, framed prints, and more. Discover inspiration at every turn, and explore a wide range of designs created by talented artists from all corners of the globe.",

    "description": "WHAT IS YAAK?\n\nYaak is developing an open-source embodied AI platform that prioritizes safety. Partnering with domain experts around the world, we collect their demonstrations and feedback to train large multimodal models (LMMs) which are then fine-tuned for downstream tasks like detecting and correcting incorrect operation and generating novel scenarios. We actually don't do anything with yaks.\n\nWHY ARE YOU WORKING ON HUMAN DRIVING?\n\nAt Yaak we asked ourselves: what if we engage domain experts in building foundation models for embodied AI (e.g human driving)?. To that end, we repurposed the existing infrastructure for human centric training processes to collect invaluable data at scale. By design the training processes encounter wide categories of scenarios required for a human to learn safe operation of the platform, allowing us to extract and build scenario cards (ranked by risk) for each city where our customer fleet operates, which are then used to train foundation embodied AI models. The scenario cards are also open-sourced for the wider embodied AI community to benchmark against, without having to operate a development fleet in a new city, bringing transparency and accountability to the development of embodied AI.\n\nTHE ROLE\n\nAs a Front-end Developer you will:\n\n\n\n * Participate in designing, writing and supporting robust, responsive and well crafted software\n * Take a leading role in documenting and designing client/server side architecture\n * Work with our designers to implement responsive frontend and interactions\n * Write clean and minimal code with a focus on readability and longevity\n * Take ownership for the quality assessment of your projects\n * Predict technical roadblocks and plan for the posterity of our software stack\n * Bring the latest and greatest of OSS tools and knowledge to our org\n   \n   \n   \n\nQualifications\n\nYou won't see hard requirements here for certain degrees or exact years of experience because we know everyone has their own unique journey.

They're the unwavering standards that anchor us in our pursuit of excellence. By embracing these principles, we empower each team member to act with confidence and purpose. They serve as our North Star, offering direction, alignment, and a constant reminder of who we are and what we stand for.\n\n\n * React to other peoples messages in group chats at a minimum once daily so everyone knows we are on the same page especially the person that put in the work. Alignment and appreciation is key.\n * Minimize communication overhead, make up your mind before meetings and conversation and if sending over information on any channel give a one sentence note on the rationale behind.\n * Stay humble in discussions. Be aware when a strong opinion or absolutistic statement arises that is often an unvalidated hypothesis. Our only job then is to clearly state the problem and test with the market. In most cases there is neither a right or wrong or black and white.\n * Be proactive and own. Especially in the early days, we require leaders, not followers, taking responsibility on their topics, setting and keeping the bar high.\n * Keep up a healthy effective communication. Everyone is responsible to pause and cut interaction immediately that runs into the wrong direction, both the person that started it and the person that continues.\n * Be on time, always, it's about respect for other people and the team's output. In any case there is any unforeseen delay, we give a written notice as early as we know to be late.\n * Only have intended meetings. Come in with a clear goal/problem statement, leave with an outcome delivery plan/solution. If meetings do not add value to your work or you can not add value to the conversation, you are allowed and encouraged to leave.\n * Execute with care and diligence. Keep files clean, check your spelling, document your work, deliver on a standard like if you were speaking in front of 1000 people or selling a book to 1M readers.\n * Neutralize weaknesses. Everyone has them, be always kind to yourself, however do not accept them to affect the team's standard to drop. Use tools to support you, the new digital age has it all, or discuss with the team on how someone with a strength in this field can support you.\n * Present a problem always with a solution draft If hitting a roadblock, take time to clearly state the problem and figure out some possible solution before interacting with the team for help. This is a thing of respect and ownership, others are not meant to fix the problem one is responsible for.\n   \n   \n\n🌟 Meet the Stellar Minds Behind Our Startup! 🌟\n\nAt the heart of our dynamic startup are two visionaries, Dana and Erik, whose passion and expertise set the tone for our journey. Supported by the incredible talents of Jonas and Adrian, our team is a vibrant blend of diverse skills and shared values.\n\nDana, our spirited co-founder, is a fitness enthusiast with a penchant for yoga and a love for the arts. Her fascination with both mathematics and human relationships adds a unique dimension to our approach, reflecting the harmony of logic and empathy.\n\nErik, the technological maestro of our team, finds joy in the thrill of cycling, the heights of climbing, and the depths of engaging podcasts. His tech-savvy mind is the driving force behind our innovations, shaping the future of our venture.\n\nJonas, a dedicated advocate for food sharing, brings a compassionate touch to our mission. His commitment to sustainability and community resonates in every aspect of our work, fostering a sense of responsibility that goes beyond business.\n\nAdrian, our artistic soul, expresses his creativity through the medium of oil paintings. His brushstrokes add color to our workspace, embodying the essence of our startup's imagination and originality.\n\nOur startup isn't just a workplace; it's more as high-performance sports-team united by a common purpose. The office exudes warmth, with at least one set of bedding always on standby and cabinets stocked with 100kg of ingredients for communal meals, from hearty lentil dishes to flavorful rice and couscous bowls.\n\nAnd because balance is key, our team ensures that fitness is woven into our daily routine through random push-up challenges and a sixpack bet. This unique blend of passion, creativity, and camaraderie is what sets us apart, fueling our motivation and propelling us towards success. Welcome to the spirited world of our startup! 🚀✨\n\nPlease also note:\n\nResearch indicates that men typically apply to jobs when they meet about 60% of the criteria, whereas women and other members of marginalized groups often apply only if they fulfill every requirement. Therefore, if you possess most of the qualifications but don't meet every single point on the job description, we encourage you to reach out.\n\nMoreover it is more about the People than the skills. We would like to encourage you to write a cover letter in which you tell us why you, Circonomit and Environmental Data Startups, are the perfect fit for you personally.\n\nAfter that we'd love to have a conversation and explore whether you could be an excellent fit for the role.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you.",

    "description": "Who we are\n\n\n\n\nHelsing is a defence AI company. Our mission is to protect our democracies. We aim to achieve technological leadership, so that open societies can continue to make sovereign decisions and control their ethical standards.\n\nAs democracies, we believe we have a special responsibility to be thoughtful about the development and deployment of powerful technologies like AI. We take this responsibility seriously.\n\nWe are an ambitious and committed team of engineers, AI specialists and customer-facing programme managers. We are looking for mission-driven people to join our European teams – and apply their skills to solve the most complex and impactful problems. We embrace an open and transparent culture that welcomes healthy debates on the use of technology in defence, its benefits, and its ethical implications.\n\n\n\n\nThe role\n\n\n\n\nTogether with our product designers and engineers, you will be responsible for creating the user-friendly UI for our spatiotemporal data in a 3D environment (browser & desktop). We need your creative vision and UX/UI sensibility to combine our user interface design seamlessly with the 3D real-time rendered world. You will be working closely with our other research and development teams to thoroughly understand the information you will be presenting.\n\n\n\n\nThe day-to-day\n\n\n\n\n * Own the user interface end-to-end (from scribble to production-ready code)\n * Create and manage our visual design together with our product management team\n * Take care of our component library and ensure its compliance with our needs (visual design, reusability, etc)\n * Design and implement our user experience frontend tech-stack\n * Create and maintain build and deployment pipelines\n * Manage data handling with sizing, bandwidth and latency requirements in mind\n * Design and implement new product features\n * Continually optimise our user experience for performance\n\n\n\n\nYou should apply if you\n\n\n\n\n * Have very strong Frontend design and coding experience with JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML and CSS\n * Are experienced with APIs and other server-client communication like REST and GraphQL\n * Have solid front-end architecture and software design ability\n * Have state of the art experience with frameworks/SDKs in frontend like React\n * Are experienced with Component Libraries like Material UI\n * Build, deployment and dependency management systems like NPM and Yarn\n * Have experience with running a live production software\n * Are passionate about development and staying on top of current techniques\n * Are able to write clear, maintainable, portable code that adheres to a well-documented coding standard\n\nNote: The above bullet points describe the ideal candidate. None of us matched all of these at once when we first joined Helsing. We encourage you to apply even if you believe you meet only part of our wish list.\n\n\n\n\nJoin Helsing and work with world-leading experts in their fields\n\n\n\n\n * Helsing’s work is important. You’ll be directly contributing to the protection of democratic countries while balancing both ethical and geopolitical concerns\n * The work is unique. We operate in a domain that has highly unusual technical requirements and constraints, and where robustness, safety, and ethical considerations are vital. You will face unique Engineering and AI challenges that make a meaningful impact in the world\n * Our work frequently takes us right up to the state of the art in technical innovation, be it reinforcement learning, distributed systems, generative AI, or deployment infrastructure. The defence industry is entering the most exciting phase of the technological development curve. Advances in our field of world are not incremental: Helsing is part of, and often leading, historic leaps forward\n * In our domain, success is a matter of order-of-magnitude improvements and novel capabilities. This means we take bets, aim high, and focus on big opportunities. Despite being a relatively young company, Helsing has already been selected for multiple significant government contracts\n * We actively encourage healthy, proactive, and diverse debate internally about what we do and how we choose to do it. Teams and individual engineers are trusted (and encouraged) to practise responsible autonomy and critical thinking, and to focus on outcomes, not conformity. At Helsing you will have a say in how we (and you!) work, the opportunity to engage on what does and doesn’t work, and to take ownership of aspects of our culture that you care deeply about\n\n\n\n\nWhat we offer\n\n\n\n\n * A focus on outcomes, not time-tracking\n * Competitive compensation and stock options\n * Relocation support\n * Social and education allowances\n * Regular company events and all-hands to bring together employees as one team across Europe\n * A hands-on onboarding program (affectionately labelled “Infraduction”), in which you will be building tooling and applications to be used across the company. This is your opportunity to learn our tech stack, explore the company, and learn how we get things done - all whilst working with other engineering teams from day one\n\n\n\n\nHelsing is an equal opportunities employer.
